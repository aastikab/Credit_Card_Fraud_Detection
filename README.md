# Credit Card Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on analyzing credit card data. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models for tasks like credit risk assessment or fraud detection.



## Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze credit card data to identify meaningful patterns and develop predictive models. Key goals include understanding customer behavior, detecting anomalies, and creating actionable insights for stakeholders.

This project was a collaborative effort completed as a group of two.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Cleaning missing values, handling duplicates, and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Generating visualizations to highlight trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Using machine learning techniques for classification tasks (e.g., fraud detection or credit approval).
- **Insights and Recommendations:**
  - Summarizing findings and proposing actionable steps based on results.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
